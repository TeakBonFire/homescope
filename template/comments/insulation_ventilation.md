# Insulation & Ventilation Comment Library

## A. Attic Insulation

Note: Typical insulation levels were observed. No deficiencies were noted.

Note: Good insulation levels were observed.

Improve: Insulation improvements may be cost-effective depending on the anticipated term of ownership.

Improve: The attic access door should be insulated for energy efficiency.

Repair: Disturbed or uneven insulation should be evened out.

Repair: Missing or incomplete insulation should be corrected by a qualified installer.

Repair: Ductwork in the attic should be better insulated to reduce energy costs.

Monitor: Vermiculite insulation was observed. Vermiculite may contain asbestos. EPA recommendations generally suggest leaving this material in place and undisturbed; consult an asbestos specialist if further evaluation is desired.

Repair (Safety): Recessed lights buried in insulation or not rated for insulation contact may pose a fire hazard. Evaluation by a qualified electrician is recommended.

### Standard Attic Limitations (Always Include When Attic Is Entered)

Note: The inspector was unable to visually see any items or components located beneath the attic insulation, such as the bottom chords of trusses, ceiling joists at the drywall, electrical wiring, or exhaust vents.

Note: Due to the size of the attic opening and the design of the roof structure, some areas of the attic space were limited and could not be seen.

## B. Crawlspace / Basement Insulation

Improve: Crawlspace insulation improvements may be desirable depending on the anticipated term of ownership.

Improve: Rim joist cavities should be insulated.

Repair/Replace: Loose or damaged insulation should be repaired or replaced.

Repair: Plumbing pipes should be insulated to protect from freezing.

Repair: Ductwork in the crawlspace or basement should be better insulated.

Repair: Crawlspace ventilation is inadequate. It is generally recommended that approximately one square foot of vent opening be provided for every 500 square feet of crawlspace floor area.

Improve: Crawlspace wall vents are obstructed and should be cleared or opened to allow air flow.

Repair: A moisture barrier should be installed on the crawlspace floor to reduce ground moisture migration.

Repair (Safety): Exposed foam board insulation is a fire hazard and should be removed or covered with an appropriate fire-resistant material.

Repair: Evidence of vermin activity was observed. Pest control treatment or monitoring is recommended.

## C. Floor Insulation

Improve: Insulation improvements may be desirable to improve the comfort of the room above.

## D. Attic & Roof Ventilation

Repair/Improve: Attic or roof ventilation should be improved. It is generally recommended that one square foot of free vent area be provided for every 150 square feet of ceiling area.

Repair: Soffit vents are obstructed; installation of baffles is recommended to maintain proper airflow from the eaves.

Repair: Roof or exhaust vents that are not screened should be screened to help prevent vermin entry.

Monitor: Sloped or cathedral ceilings are rarely well ventilated and may be more prone to concealed moisture problems. Monitor for signs of distress over time.

Repair: A bathroom exhaust fan was found to be inoperable. Repair or replacement is recommended.

Repair: An attic power ventilator was found to be inoperable. Repair or replacement is recommended if relied upon for ventilation.

Repair: Bathroom exhaust vents should discharge to the building exterior rather than into the attic or other concealed spaces.

## E. Dryer Vent Limitations

Note: Portions of the dryer vent piping may be concealed by insulation or wall/ceiling finishes and could not be fully inspected.

---

## F. General Energy Efficiency Note

Monitor: Insulation levels affect heating and cooling costs. Current energy standards generally recommend around R-49 attic insulation in this region for new homes. Existing homes may have less.
