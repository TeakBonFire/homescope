## 1. Roof Covering – Pitched Roof

### Note – Good / Normal Condition

Note: Roofing was in good condition. We did not see evidence of active leaks nor need for immediate major repair.

Note: The roof shows signs of normal wear and tear consistent with its age and exposure to the elements. These include minor weathering of shingles, slight granule loss, and minor wear around flashings. There are no signs of immediate concern or major damage at this time. Regular maintenance and periodic inspections are recommended.

Note: Due to the aging roof and multiple vulnerable areas (see photos), it is recommended that the entire roofing system be further evaluated by a qualified roofing contractor to assess its overall condition and ensure there are no underlying issues that could affect its performance. This evaluation will help determine if additional repairs or replacement are needed.

### Minor Repairs

Repair/Replace (Minor Repairs): Minor repairs to the roofing are needed. Damaged or missing roofing material should be repaired. All roof penetrations should be examined and sealed as necessary. Aging or loose flashing can cause leaks; these items should be maintained periodically to prevent water intrusion.

### End of Life / Deferred Cost

Deferred Cost Item (End Life – Minor): The roofing is nearing the end of its useful life. While replacement is not needed right away, it should be anticipated soon. Repairs may be possible to extend roof life. Recommend contacting a qualified roofing contractor for further evaluation.

Repair/Replace (End Life – Major): Based on the inspection, the roof is approaching the end of its expected lifespan and shows signs of significant wear, including visible shingle damage and areas of deterioration. It is strongly recommended that the roof be replaced to ensure the home remains protected from potential water intrusion and further structural damage.

### Wear / Condition Monitoring

Monitor (Uneven Wear): The roofing is in fair condition, with different areas wearing at different rates. Roof surfaces more exposed to sunlight and weather wear more quickly, while shaded areas may develop staining or moss that increases wear. Early repair or partial replacement may be needed before full roof replacement.

Monitor (Fair Condition): The roofing is in fair condition. We did not see evidence of active leaks nor the need for immediate major repair.

Monitor (Prior Repairs): Prior repairs to the roofing are evident. This suggests that problems have been experienced in the past. This area should be monitored for changes.

### Hail, Flaws, Multiple Layers, Poor Workmanship, Moss

Possible Repair (Hail Damage): Roof shows evidence of possible hail damage. Recommend further evaluation by a licensed roofing contractor to determine if repairs or replacement are needed. This may qualify as an insurance claim depending on the extent of the damage.

Monitor (Multiple Layers): The weight of multiple layers of roofing shingles can stress the roof framing and may cause rafters or trusses to bow. Multiple layers also retain heat and can prematurely age the roof. While this is not a serious short-term concern, it increases the risk of future issues.

Monitor (Poor Workmanship): The roofing is in fair condition but appears to have been installed with poor workmanship. While this may not pose an immediate concern, it increases the risk of leaks and premature aging of roofing materials.

Possible Repair (Flaws): The roofing shows evidence of installation or material flaws. These conditions may accelerate wear and lead to premature leaks. A warranty claim might be possible if the current owner installed the roof. Evaluation by a qualified roofing contractor is recommended.

Monitor (Moss Growth): The roofing is in fair condition but shows moss and organic buildup in shaded areas. This can reduce the life expectancy of the roofing. Trimming or removing trees may improve this condition.

### Older Roof / Wood Roof / Vulnerable Design

Monitor (Older Roof): Older roofs are, by their nature, high-maintenance systems. Annual inspection and repair should be anticipated. Older flashings should be monitored closely; deteriorated flashing can result in expensive repairs because sections of the roofing must be removed. As a general rule, replacement of the roofing system should be planned when maintenance becomes increasingly frequent.

Monitor (Wood Roof): The life expectancy of wood roofs is generally twenty-five to forty years. This depends on shingle/shake quality, roof slope, exposure, and shading. As with all roofs, annual maintenance is needed. Cracked, curled, or deteriorated wood shingles should be repaired or replaced as needed.

Monitor (Vulnerable Areas): The design of the roofing system is such that several vulnerable areas exist where there is a higher potential for leaks. Annual inspections and ongoing maintenance will be critical.

### Debris / Exposed Sheathing / Ridge Caps / Re-roofing Notes / Waviness

Repair (Debris): Debris should be removed from the roofing to reduce the risk of leaks and early roof wear.

Repair (Exposed OSB/Plywood): Exposed sheathing is visible where the roofing is damaged. Damaged or missing roofing material should be repaired.

Repair/Replace (Damaged Ridge Caps): Split, loose, or damaged ridge caps of the roofing require repair or replacement.

Note: It is recommended that the present layers of roofing materials be removed prior to re-roofing. This adds demolition and debris-removal cost to the re-roof cost.

Note: The south and west sides of a roof typically wear faster than the balance of the roof, while the other exposures may last longer. If the best roof sections have less than five years of remaining life when the worst sections already need replacement, it is usually logical to replace all roof slopes during re-roofing.

Note: Replace the roof flashing materials when re-roofing to avoid leaks in these areas.

Note: Unfavorable weather restricted the inspection of the roofing system at time of inspection. The seller should be consulted regarding the age and condition of the roof. If weather permits, the roof should be inspected by a qualified roofer or inspector prior to closing.

Improve (Waviness): Waviness was noted in the roofing surface. This is a relatively common condition in older homes and may be the result of inadequate ventilation. Refer to the ventilation section for additional information.

## 2. Roof Covering – Flat Roof

Major Concern, Repair (Flat Roof End of Life): The flat rubber roofing is at end of life and should be replaced.

Deferred Cost Item (Flat Roof Nearing End of Life): The flat roofing is near the end of its life. The membrane exhibits flaws (such as blistering, cracking, etc.) that are symptomatic of an old flat roof. Watch for leaks and expect to replace the roof soon.

Monitor (Missing Gravel – End of Life): The flat roofing is near the end of its life. Gravel on the membrane is missing. This typically leads to a shortened life expectancy. Missing gravel could be replaced. Expect to replace this roof soon.

Monitor (Flat Roof – Fair Condition): The flat roofing is in fair condition. We did not see evidence of active leaks nor need for immediate major repair.

Monitor (Fair – No Gravel): The flat roofing is in fair condition. The lack of gravel on the membrane has led to a shortened life expectancy. Applying gravel over the membrane may help to prolong the life of this roof.

Monitor (Fair – Water Ponding): The flat roofing is in fair condition. Water appears to pond on the membrane. Ponding shortens roof life and increases the potential for damage if leaks occur. When re-roofing, the roof should be appropriately sloped, or drains should be provided.

Monitor (Poor Workmanship – Flat Roof): The roofing material is in reasonably good condition but the workmanship was poor and this roofing material is not recommended for flat roofs. While this condition does not pose a serious short-term concern it means short roof life and increased risk of leaks.

Repair (Maintenance Needed – Flat Roof): The flat roof requires maintenance. Moss should be cleared from the roof, voids in the gravel should be improved, and any blisters should be repaired.

Monitor (Prior Repairs – Flat Roof): Prior repairs to the flat roof are evident. This would suggest that problems have been experienced in the past. This area should be monitored.

## 3. Flashing & Roof Penetrations

Repair: Flashing appears improperly sealed or deteriorated at (location). This condition may allow moisture intrusion. Repairs are recommended.

Repair: Gaps were observed at flashing around roof penetrations (vent pipes, chimneys, etc.). Corrections are recommended to help prevent leakage.

Monitor: Small gaps or aged sealant were observed around plumbing or HVAC vent penetrations. Monitor and reseal as needed.

Monitor: Skylight flashing or sealant shows signs of aging or wear. Monitor for leakage.

## 4. Roof Drainage (Gutters & Downspouts)

Repair: Loose gutter spikes should be resecured to avoid gutter movement or water intrusion.

Repair: Evidence of gutter overflow was observed at (location). This may indicate clogging, undersized gutters, or improper slope.

Repair: Downspout extensions are missing or are improperly directed. Extensions should discharge water away from the foundation.

Repair: Downspouts that discharge too close to the foundation may contribute to moisture problems. Redirection is recommended.

Repair: Portions of the gutter system appear sagging or improperly sloped. This can cause overflow; adjustment is recommended.

## 5. Other Roofing Findings

Improve: We recommend removal of the satellite dish from the roof.

Improve: The satellite dish bracket should be removed and penetrations sealed to help prevent moisture intrusion.
