## A. Standard Maintenance (Always Included for Homes with Windows)

[[Window Maintenance]]
Maintenance Item: While the windows in the home were in fair condition, it’s important to perform general window maintenance such as cleaning, lubricating, and adjustments to ensure proper function and avoid premature deterioration. As the windows age, hardware replacement or repairs—such as locking mechanisms, safety latches, or handles—may be needed to restore full function. The most important factor is that the windows remain effective as a barrier against moisture intrusion and remain energy efficient.

[[Disrepair]]
Repair: The windows are in mild disrepair. This is a common condition that does not necessitate immediate major repair. Trimming and adjustment, hardware improvements, or glazing repairs would be logical long-term improvements. In practice, improvements are usually made on an as-needed basis only. The most important factor is that the window exteriors are well-maintained to avoid rot or water infiltration.
