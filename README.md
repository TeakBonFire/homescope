# HomeScope

**AI-Powered Home Inspection Assistant**

HomeScope is a next-generation home inspection tool designed to help inspectors finish their reports before leaving the property. By combining voice input, photo recognition, and smart automation, HomeScope simplifies your workflow — capturing data on the go and compiling a polished, professional report.

## 🔍 Key Features

- 🎙️ **Voice-to-Comment AI** – Speak your observations while inspecting, and HomeScope will transcribe, categorize, and insert them into the right report section.
- 📸 **Smart Photo Labeling** – Photos are automatically tagged, labeled, and placed based on visual recognition and inspector prompts.
- 📋 **Section Checklist** – Know at a glance which sections have been completed, skipped, or still need attention.
- 🧠 **Comment Autoselection** – AI matches your voice notes to prewritten comments for consistency and speed.
- 🧾 **Instant Summary Generation** – Blue = repair, Orange = maintenance, Green = info/improvement — color-coded and client-ready.
- 🔄 **ISN Integration** – Sync client and property data, schedule info, and email delivery directly through the Inspection Support Network.

## 📱 The Vision
HomeScope aims to replace the clipboard and post-inspection office hours with real-time reporting powered by AI. When fully implemented, you'll be able to:

- Arrive on-site and pull data from ISN
- Talk through the home while snapping photos
- Let the app organize, comment, and label everything
- Leave with a complete report, ready for review and delivery

## 🚧 Status
Currently in development. We’re starting with a mobile prototype and report template system based on real-world inspection needs.
